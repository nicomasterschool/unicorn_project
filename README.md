# ü¶Ñ **Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights**  

---

## üìÑ **Context**  
Unicorn is a family-owned business in the E-commerce sector, offering a wide range of products across three main categories: technology, furniture, and office supplies. Although Unicorn has already collected substantial data, the data analysis (DA) team is in the process of expanding.

---

## üéØ **Objective**  
The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into sales, profits, and order trends for the time period 2015‚Äì2018. Users should be able to filter results by time period, region, and product. The project focused on structuring the data and assembling the relevant pieces to provide quick, valuable insights.

## üöÄ **Approach and Implementation**  
I designed an interactive dashboard offering an overview of several key performance indicators (KPIs). The distribution of orders highlighted a concentration in the West and East regions, with a smaller contribution from the Northeast. Key observations include:  

- **Consistent growth in sales over the years**, with peaks in September and dips in October. Sales recover significantly in November and peak during the Christmas season.  
- The **top and bottom-performing products** both belong to the technology category. However, the bottom performers were sold at substantial discounts, leading to significant losses.  
- Differences were observed between product categories: Office Supplies and Technology contributed positively to all-time profits, while Furniture had uneven performance across its subcategories.

## üìä **Project Steps**  

1. **SQL Queries**  
   - Explored the Unicorn database using SQL to answer key questions about sales, profit, and customer behavior.  
   - Cleaned and joined tables, performed aggregations, and ranked cities, products, and regions by their performance.  
   - Documented queries to ensure reproducibility.  

2. **Google Sheets Analysis**  
   - Aggregated data using pivot tables to analyze performance by product category and customer segment.  
   - Developed calculated metrics (e.g., price per unit, profit margin).  
   - Applied conditional formatting to highlight opportunities for growth and underperforming regions.

3. **Tableau Dashboard**  
   - Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to present KPIs, trends, and actionable recommendations for business decision-making.

## üîç **Insights**  
- **High-performing regions:** The West and East regions generated the highest profits and order volumes.  
- **Product profitability:** Office Supplies and Technology were the main contributors to overall profitability, while certain Furniture subcategories underperformed.  
- **Significant losses on discounts:** Technology products with high prices and discounts exceeding 50% contributed to overall losses.  
- **Seasonal trends:** Sales peaked during November and December, with consistent growth across the analyzed period.

---

## üîÆ **Future Work**  
- **Analyze discount patterns:** Investigate why certain high-priced products were heavily discounted, and determine if there‚Äôs a risk of fraud or inefficiencies in the discounting process.  
- **Expand data collection:** Gather additional data, such as return rates, product conditions, and customer feedback, to further refine product-level insights.  
- **Optimize product portfolio:** Discontinue or revamp underperforming products based on profitability and customer feedback.  
- **Expand marketing efforts:** Collaborate with the marketing team to increase order volumes in underrepresented regions (e.g., central states).

---

## üåü **Standout Section**  
- **Beyond Instructions:** While following the core requirements, I also explored subcategories, applied calculated metrics in Google Sheets (e.g., price per unit, profit margin), and customized Tableau filters for region-specific insights. This allowed for deeper analysis beyond basic KPIs.

## ‚úÖ **Recommendations**  
- Investigate and address the high discounts on underperforming technology products.  
- Collaborate with the marketing team to increase order volumes in underrepresented regions.  
- Consider discontinuing or redesigning products with consistent losses or low performance.  
- Collect additional data (e.g., customer feedback, return conditions) to further improve product strategy.  

By addressing these recommendations, Unicorn has the potential to turn its current stable profit trend into a growing one.
